This is the academic website of Matthew Dannenberg!  I'm a Ph.D. candidate at Stony Brook University, working with [Mikhail Lyubich](https://www.math.stonybrook.edu/~mlyubich/).  I'm really interested in understanding how dynamical systems transition into chaotic behavior and how this relates to the theory of phase transitions in statistical physics.

This site is still under construction.

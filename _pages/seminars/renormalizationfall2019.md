This seminar aims to briefly discuss a few different manifestations of renormalization in differential equations, dynamical systems, and statistical physics.  Our goal will be to arrive at a better _intuitive_ understanding of what renormalization is, with the hope of using this as a launching point for future discussions during next semester's [Simons Center Program](http://scgp.stonybrook.edu/archives/29517).  

This is intended to be a discussion-based seminar.  People with any level of background are welcome, and everyone is encouraged to ask questions.

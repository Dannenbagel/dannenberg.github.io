During this seminar we will investigate in depth a topic related to analysis.  

This is a graduate student seminar, with talks given by graduate students participants.  It is didactic in tone, as we all attempt together to understand the topic being discussed.  Of course, people with any level of background are welcome, and everyone is especially encouraged to ask questions.

All meetings are held on Wednesdays at 4pm in the Math Tower, Room 5-127.

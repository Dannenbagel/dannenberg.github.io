During this seminar we will investigate Liouville Quantum Gravity in some depth.  

This is a graduate student seminar, with talks given by graduate students participants.  It is didactic in tone, as we all attempt together to understand the topic being discussed.  Of course, people with any level of background are welcome, and everyone is especially encouraged to ask questions.

All meetings are held on Wednesdays at 4pm in the Math Tower, Room 5-127.

## Relevant Materials

This [course website](http://math.mit.edu/~sheffield/fall2017math177.html) from a 2017 MIT class taught by Scott Sheffield contains several really useful resources.

#### Probability

  * Lawler, _Notes on Probability_ [Prob1](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~lawler/probnotes.pdf)
    * A crash course to terminology common in probability.  Particularly useful as a reference.
    * Some extra terminology to be aware of which is not used in Lawler:
      1. The **law** of a random variable is termed the **distribution** of the random variable in Lawler - both mean the same thing.  If $f: \Omega \to X$ is a random variable with $P$ the probability measure on $\Omega$, then the **law** of $f$ is the resulting pushforward measure on $X$.
      2. If $(\Omega_1, P_1)$ and $(\Omega_2, P_2)$ are probability spaces with $f: \Omega_1 \times \Omega_2 \to X$ (for $X$ a vector space), then the **marginal** or **marginal distribution** of $f$ on $\Omega_1$ is the random variable $\int_{\Omega_2} f(x,y) dP_2(y)$.
  * Lawler, _Conformally Invariant Processes in the Plane_ [Prob2](http://users.ictp.it/~pub_off/lectures/lns017/Lawler/Lawler.pdf)
    * Chapter 2 is a useful reference for some of the basic properties of Brownian Motion, particularly conformal invariance.
  * `Uncertain Author`, _Stochastic Analyis, An Introduction_ [Prob3](http://math.tkk.fi/teaching/stokanal/lecture3.pdf)
    * The proof of the martingale convergence theorem and some useful other results are contained within.
  * Bell, _The Kolmogorov Extension Theorem_ [Prob4](http://individual.utoronto.ca/jordanbell/notes/kolmogorov.pdf)
    * This contains some nice review about $\sigma$-algebras and leads to the proof of the Kolmogorov Extension Theorem.
  * Berestycki, _Stochastic Calculus and Applications_ [Prob5](http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~beresty/teach/sc3.pdf)
    * A thorough introduction to stochastic calculus.  Largely unneeded by us, it's still useful as a reference.
  * Taylor, _Random Fields_ [Prob6](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~jtaylo/courses/stats352/notes/random_fields.pdf)
    * This is included as a reference mainly for sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2, which give a good self-contained definition of _Gaussian Random Variables_.
      * Extra terminology: A **centered Gaussian random variable** is a Gaussian random variable with mean 0.

#### Gaussian Free Fields

  * Sheffield, _Gaussian Free Fields for Mathematicians_ [GFF1](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0312099)
    * A formal, functional-analytic description of Gaussian Free Fields.
  * Werner, _Topics on the two-dimensional Gaussian Free Field_ [GFF2](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2607/b47d11a2b1758063795bb33348d9f963011d.pdf)
    * A mostly probabilistic description of the 2D Gaussian Free Field with some intuition from Brownian Motion.

#### Liouville Quantum Gravity

  * Gwynne, _Random Surfaces and Liouville Quantum Gravity_ [LQG1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05573)
    * This is a survey article written specifically to be readable to graduate students.  We use it as a rough outline for the goals of this seminar.
  * Berestycki, _Introduction to the Gaussian Free Field and Liouville Quantum Gravity_ [LQG2](http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~beresty/Articles/oxford4.pdf)
    * This is written to be a softer introduction to Liouville Quantum Gravity, assuming only a background in probability.
  * Chern, _An Elementary Proof of the Existence of Isothermal Parameters on a Surface_ [LQG3](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2032933)
    * For any so curious, this paper proves the existence of isothermal coordinates using only the assumption that the Riemannian metric is Holder continuous.

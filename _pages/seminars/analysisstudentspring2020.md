During this seminar we will investigate in depth a topic related to analysis.  

This is a graduate student seminar, with talks given by graduate students participants.  It is didactic in tone, as we all attempt together to understand the topic being discussed.  Of course, people with any level of background are welcome, and everyone is especially encouraged to ask questions.

All meetings are held on Wednesdays at 4pm in the Math Tower, Room 5-127.

## Relevant Materials

This [course website](http://math.mit.edu/~sheffield/fall2017math177.html) from a 2017 MIT class taught by Scott Sheffield contains several really useful resources.

#### Gaussian Free Fields

	* Sheffield, _Gaussian Free Fields for Mathematicians_ [GFF1](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0312099)
		* A formal, functional-analytic description of Gaussian Free Fields.
	* Werner, _Topics on the two-dimensional Gaussian Free Field_ [GFF2](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2607/b47d11a2b1758063795bb33348d9f963011d.pdf)
		* A mostly probabilistic description of the 2D Gaussian Free Field with some intuition from Brownian Motion.

#### Liouville Quantum Gravity

	* Gwynne, _Random Surfaces and Liouville Quantum Gravity_ [LQV1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05573)
		* This is a survey article written specifically to be readable to graduate students.  We use it as an overall outline for this seminar.
